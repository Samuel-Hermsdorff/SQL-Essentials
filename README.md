# SQL Essentials

This repository contains my structured learning path and hands-on practice with SQL.  
It is organized into folders that demonstrate my progress from fundamental queries to practical projects that simulate real data workflows.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### ✔️ Practice Queries
Small, focused exercises covering:
- SELECT statements  
- Filtering and ordering  
- JOIN operations  
- Aggregations and GROUP BY  
- Subqueries  
- Window functions  
- Data cleaning with SQL  

### ✔️ Mini Projects
Practical SQL applications, including:
- **Insurance ETL Pipeline:** ingesting, cleaning, and transforming datasets.  
- **Sales KPI Dashboard (SQL version):** creating analytical queries for BI dashboards.  
- **Customer Segmentation:** grouping customers using SQL-based logic.

### ✔️ Capstone Projects (Future)
Larger, end-to-end projects that combine:
- Database design  
- SQL queries  
- Python for data analysis  
- BI dashboards  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- SQL (SQLite / PostgreSQL compatible)
- Python (for ETL scripting when needed)
- Power BI (for optional dashboard visualization)

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository demonstrates:
- Practical SQL knowledge  
- Ability to build analytical queries  
- Understanding of data pipelines  
- Preparation for data roles such as analytics, ETL, and BI support
